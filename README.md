## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the application of Deep Learning architectures—**MLP, LSTM, and CNN (GAF)**—to predict the directional returns of Bitcoin (BTC-USD).

The core objective is not merely prediction, but a rigorous **forensic analysis of Data Leakage** in financial machine learning. We demonstrate how improper preprocessing (Global Scaling) can artificially inflate backtest performance and how a robust **Walk-Forward Validation** pipeline exposes these flaws.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Multi-Model Approach:** Comparative analysis of dense (MLP), recurrent (LSTM), and image-based (CNN-GAF) neural networks.
* **Gramian Angular Fields:** Novel application of converting time-series data into images for CNN processing.
* **Leakage Simulation:** Deliberate injection of "Look-Ahead Bias" to demonstrate common backtesting pitfalls.
* **Robust Validation:** Implementation of a strict, leakage-free Non-Anchored Walk-Forward Validation pipeline.

## 📊 Results Summary
Our analysis reveals a critical insight for algorithmic trading:
| Scenario | MLP Accuracy | Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1 (Static Split + Leakage)** | **52.78%** | Apparent predictive edge. |
| **Step 2 (Walk-Forward + Leakage)** | **52.86%** | "Edge" persists with frequent retraining. |
| **Step 3 (Robust No-Leakage)** | **49.93%** | **Edge disappears.** Returns to random chance. |

**Conclusion:** The initial success was driven by **backtest overfitting**. When strictly isolated, historical price data alone provided no consistent signal for the test period.
